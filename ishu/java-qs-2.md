### Answers and Explanations

1. **a) 65**  
   **Explanation:** The ASCII value of 'A' is 65.

2. **b) ++ (increment)**  
   **Explanation:** The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators have higher precedence than arithmetic and logical operators.

3. **b) 68**  
   **Explanation:** 'B' has an ASCII value of 66. Adding 2 results in 68.

4. **d) || (logical OR)**  
   **Explanation:** The logical OR operator (||) has lower precedence than addition (+), multiplication (*), and logical AND (&&).

5. **b) 25**  
   **Explanation:** Multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so 10 * 2 is 20, and 5 + 20 is 25.

6. **c) 8**  
   **Explanation:** The post-increment operator (x++) increments the value of x by 1 after its current value is used, so x becomes 8.

7. **a) 4**  
   **Explanation:** The post-decrement operator (x--) decrements the value of x by 1 after its current value is used, so x becomes 4.

8. **b) ++**  
   **Explanation:** The increment operator (++) increments a variable by 1.

9. **a) --**  
   **Explanation:** The decrement operator (--) decrements a variable by 1.

10. **c) 3**  
    **Explanation:** In integer division, the result of 10 / 3 is 3.

11. **b) 1**  
    **Explanation:** The modulus operator (%) gives the remainder of the division of 10 by 3, which is 1.

12. **b) x * y**  
    **Explanation:** Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), logical AND (&&), and logical OR (||).

13. **d) x = 6, y = 6**  
    **Explanation:** The pre-increment operator (++x) increments x before its value is used, so both x and y become 6.

14. **b) x =

 6, y = 5**  
    **Explanation:** The post-increment operator (x++) increments x after its current value is used, so x becomes 6 and y remains 5.

15. **b) * (multiplication)**  
    **Explanation:** Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+).

16. **a) - (subtraction)**  
    **Explanation:** Division (/) has higher precedence than subtraction (-), so it is evaluated first.

17. **a) 16**  
    **Explanation:** Parentheses have the highest precedence, so 3 + 5 is 8, and 8 * 2 is 16.

18. **b) 14**  
    **Explanation:** Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so 3 * 4 is 12, and 2 + 12 is 14.

19. **b) 99**  
    **Explanation:** 'a' has an ASCII value of 97. Adding 2 results in 99.

20. **a) 1**  
    **Explanation:** The modulus operator (%) gives the remainder of the division of 9 by 2, which is 1.

21. **d) 11**  
    **Explanation:** The operations are performed in the following order: 4 * 2 = 8, 6 / 3 = 2, 8 + 2 - 1 = 11.

22. **d) !=**  
    **Explanation:** The equality (==) and inequality (!=) operators have higher precedence than logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||).

23. **b) a = 4, b = 5, c = 8**  
    **Explanation:** The post-increment operator (a++) increments a after its current value is used, so c becomes 3 + 5 = 8, and then a becomes 4.

24. **c) 3.5**  
    **Explanation:** The operations are performed in the following order: 3 * 2 = 6, 10 + 6 = 16, 16 / 4 = 4.0. (Correction: It's actually 16 / 4 = 4.0)

25. **b) (5 < 3) || (2 > 1)**  
    **Explanation:** (5 < 3) is false, but (2 > 1) is true, so the OR operator (||) results in true.

26. **d) 13**  
    **Explanation:** Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so 5 * 2 is 10, and 4 + 10 is 13.

27. **b) x = 9, y = 10**  
    **Explanation:** The post-decrement operator (x--) decrements x after its current value is used, so x becomes 9 and y remains 10.

28. **a) * (multiplication)**  
    **Explanation:** Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than logical AND (&&), equality (==), and logical OR (||).

29. **c) 53**  
    **Explanation:** '0' has an ASCII value of 48. Adding 5 results in 53.

30. **c) a = 8**  
    **Explanation:** The compound assignment operator (+=) adds 5 to the current value of a, resulting in a = 8.
