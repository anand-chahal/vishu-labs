### Explanations

1. **a) 65** - The ASCII value of 'A' is 65.
2. **a) 67** - 'A' + 2 results in 65 + 2 which is 67.
3. **b) 'B'** - Incrementing 'A' gives 'B' (ASCII 66).
4. **d) ++** - The increment operator has higher precedence than multiplication and addition.
5. **a) 97** - The ASCII value of 'a' is 97.
6. **a) 'A'** - 'a' - 32 results in the ASCII value of 'A'.
7. **a) 'y'** - Decrementing 'z' gives 'y' (ASCII 121).
8. **c) =** - The assignment operator has the lowest precedence.
9. **b) 11** - Multiplication is performed before addition: 2 * 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.
10. **a) 5** - The post-increment operator returns the current value before incrementing.
11. **c) =** - The assignment operator is right-associative.
12. **b) 48** - The ASCII value of '0' is 48.
13. **d) 53** - '0' + 5 results in 48 + 5 which is 53.
14. **a) '1'** - Incrementing '0' gives '1' (ASCII 49).
15. **a) 21** - Parentheses change the precedence: (5 + 2) * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21.
16. **b) 6** - The pre-increment operator increments the value before returning it.
17. **b) ++** - The increment operator ++ is used to increase a value by 1.
18. **b) 64** - The ASCII value of '@' is 64.
19. **a) 65** - '@' + 1 results in 64 + 1 which is 65.
20. **a) 'A'** - Incrementing '@' gives 'A' (ASCII 65).
21. **b) 25** - Division and multiplication are performed left to right: 10 / 2 * 5 = 5 * 5 = 25.
22. **a) 10** - The post-decrement operator returns the current value before decrementing.
23. **a) --** - The decrement operator -- is used to decrease a value by 1.
24. **c) 90** - The ASCII value of 'Z' is 90.
25. **b) 91** - 'Z' + 1 results in 90 + 1 which is 91.
26. **a) '['** - Incrementing 'Z' gives '[' (ASCII 91).
27. **a) 5** - Parentheses change the precedence: 20 / (2 * 2) = 20 / 4 = 5.
28. **a) 19** - The pre-decrement operator decrements the value before returning it.
29. **a) * ** - Multiplication has higher precedence than addition.
30. **a) 49** - The ASCII value of '1' is 49.
31. **a) 50** - '1' + 1 results in 49 + 1 which is 50.
32. **a) '2'** - Incrementing '1' gives '2' (ASCII 50).
33. **d) 4** - Parentheses change the precedence: (10 + 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4.
34. **a) 22** - Post-increment and pre-increment operators: 10 + 1 + 11 = 22.
35. **b) =** - The assignment operator has lower precedence than the increment operator.
36. **b) 53** - The ASCII value of '5' is 53.
37. **d) 51** - '5' - 1 results in 53 - 1 which is 52.
38. **a) '4'** - Decrementing '5' gives '4' (ASCII 52).
39. **d) 4** - Division is performed before addition: 8 / 4 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.
40. **c) 2** - Post-decrement and pre-decrement operators: 8 - 6 = 2.
