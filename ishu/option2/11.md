### Explanations

1. **b) if (x > 10) {}** - This is the correct syntax for an `if` statement.
2. **a) x is greater than 3** - The `if` condition is true, so the statement inside the block is executed.
3. **a) if (x > 10) { } else { }** - This is the correct syntax for an `if-else` statement.
4. **b) x is less than or equal to 10** - The `if` condition is false, so the `else` block is executed.
5. **a) if (x > 10) { } else if (x > 5) { } else { }** - This is the correct syntax for an `else-if` ladder.
6. **b) x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10** - The `else if` condition is true, so that block is executed.
7. **a) switch (x) { case 1: break; case 2: break; }** - This is the correct syntax for a `switch` statement.
8. **b) x is 2** - The `switch` statement matches the value of `x` with case 2.
9. **b) switch (x) { case 1: break; case 2: break; default: break; }** - This is the correct syntax for a `switch` statement with a `default` case.
10. **c) x is not 1 or 2** - The `default` case is executed as `x` does not match any of the cases.
11. **a) To exit the switch statement** - The `break` statement exits the `switch` statement.
12. **c) x is 2 x is not 1** - The `break` statement is missing, so the code falls through to the `default` case.
13. **b) &&** - The `&&` operator is the logical AND operator.
14. **b) false** - The logical AND of `true` and `false` is `false`.
15. **d) ||** - The `||` operator is the logical OR operator.
16. **a) true** - The logical OR of `true` and `false` is `true`.
17. **d) !** - The `!` operator is the logical NOT operator.
18. **b) false** - The logical NOT of `true` is `false`.
19. **a) int result = (a > b) ? a : b;** - This is the correct syntax for the ternary operator.
20. **b) 10** - The condition `(a > b)` is false, so the value of `b` is assigned to `result`.
21. **a) if (x > 10) { if (y > 5) { } }** - This is the correct syntax for nested `if` statements.
22. **b) y is less than or equal to 7** - The `if` condition for `y` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
23. **a) switch (str) { case "a": break; case "b": break; }** - This is the correct syntax for a `switch` statement with `String`.
24. **b) str is b** - The `switch` statement matches the value of `str` with case "b".
25. **a) Condition is true** - Both conditions in the `if` statement are true, so the block is executed.
26. **a) Condition is true** - The logical OR condition is true, so the block is executed.
27. **b) str1.equals(str2)** - The `equals` method is used to compare `String` objects for equality.
28. **a) true** - The `equals` method returns `true` because `str1` and `str2` have the same value.
29. **b) x is 10** - The condition `x != 10` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
30. **a) if (x % 2 == 0)** - This is the correct way to check if an integer is even.
31. **a) x is even** - The condition `x % 2 == 0` is true, so the block is executed.
32. **b) x is odd** - The condition `x % 2 == 0` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
33. **a) switch (ch) { case 'a': break; case 'b': break; }** - This is the correct syntax for a `switch` statement with `char`.
34. **a) ch is a** - The `switch` statement matches the value of `ch` with case 'a'.
35. **d) All of the above** - All of these are correct ways to use the `if` statement with multiple conditions.
36. **a) Both x and y are positive** - Both conditions in the `if` statement are true, so the block is executed.
37. **a) At least one of x or y is positive** - The logical OR condition is true, so the block is executed.
38. **a) Neither x nor y is positive** - The logical NOT condition is true, so the block is executed.
39. **a) x is positive** - The condition `x > 0` is true, so the block is executed.
40. **a) switch (x) { case 1: break; case 2: break; }** - This is the correct syntax for a `switch` statement with `int`.
