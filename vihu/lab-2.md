## Q4 Pythogorean triples
Pythogorean triplet is a tuple of three inters `(a, b, c)` such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. For example, (3, 4, 5) is a pythogorean triplet.

Write a program to find all Pythogorean triplets where a, b and c are less than 100.

Bonus question: Remove multiples of base triplets. For example (6, 8, 10) is a multiple of (3, 4, 5) so should *not* be included
